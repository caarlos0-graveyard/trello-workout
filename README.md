# trello-workout
I use Trello to manage my Gym workout and I tired to move cards. Deal with it.

So, I have a Board called "Workout", with to lists: TODO and Done.

I have my workout divided in four "series" (A, B, C, D). Every day I move
the current serie to the TODO List. As I do the exercises, I annotate
the weight I lifted and move them to Done.

I was tired to move this stuff by hand, so I created this script.

I also intend to collect the lifted weight data and do some charts and
stuff.
